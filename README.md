Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the code that needs to be tested. The process is primarily divided into the following iterative steps: writing a test that defines a function or improvements of a function, producing the minimum amount of code to pass the test, and then refactoring the code to acceptable standards. One of the major advantages of TDD is that it ensures a reliable and bug-free codebase, as the code is continuously tested during development. This results in a reduction of bugs in the production, which saves a lot of time and resources in the long run. TDD also promotes simpler designs and inspires confidence in developers as they make enhancements or refactor code, ensuring that existing functionality is not broken. Additionally, since tests are written before the code, TDD ensures that the system is thoroughly tested and has a test coverage for all possible scenarios, including edge cases.

However, TDD also has its drawbacks. The process can be time-consuming and may lead to longer development cycles, especially in the initial phases of development. New developers or teams unfamiliar with TDD might find it challenging to adapt to this methodology, leading to a steep learning curve. Writing tests for every small functionality can become tedious, and if not done correctly, it can lead to an overemphasis on passing the tests rather than writing good quality, maintainable code. Furthermore, TDD requires a clear understanding of the requirements before starting the development. In scenarios where requirements are constantly changing or not clear, TDD might not be the most suitable development approach. Additionally, TDD does not guarantee that the code is completely bug-free or that it fulfills all the user requirements, as the effectiveness of TDD largely depends on the quality of the tests written.
